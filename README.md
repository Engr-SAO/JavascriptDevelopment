# Hooke's law simulation
This repository simulates Hooke's law experiment.
A spring attached to a tripod stand is pulled down by different masses attached. 
The students are required to measure using the meter rule the length of extension of the spring as different masses are been attached.
From several measurements, the students will plot the graph of the extension against the force applied.
Using the graph, the student will compute the slope which equals the spring constant.
K = F/e 
where K =  spring constant,
F = is the applied force
e =  extension
